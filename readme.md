This SMOKE detector will detect smoke and  other harmful gasses such as PROPANE,  BUTANE, HYDROGEN, ALCHOHOL, etc., and will  activate the buzzer.
SMOKE DETECTOR will also alert the authorized  person by sending a text SMS, alerting about  the smoke detected in the detector

As smoke particles enter the smoke  chamber, the smoke particles attach  themselves to the ionized air molecules and  the air in the chamber becomes less  conductive
• When the air conductivity within the  chamber drops below a predetermined  level, the alarm is triggered

Arduino is an open-source platform used for  building electronics projects. Arduino consists of  both a physical programmable circuit board (often  referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of  software, or IDE (Integrated Development  Environment) that runs on your computer, used to  write and upload computer code to the physical  board

Arduino or Arduino boards can be used to build  our own PERSONAL projects by implementing one personal code into the Arduino board so that  the Arduino board responds and gives the specific  output the user wants.

How does the MQ2 Sensor work?
How does it Work? The voltage that the sensor outputs changes according to the smoke/gas level that exists in the atmosphere. The sensor outputs a voltage that is proportional to the concentration of smoke/gas. In other words, the relationship between voltage and gas concentration is the following:
  •  The greater the gas concentration, the greater the output
voltage
  • The lower the gas concentration, the lower the output
voltage
